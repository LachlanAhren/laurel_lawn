<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What is Cremation?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Cremation is the process of reducing the human body to bone fragments using high heat and flame.  Cremation is not the final disposition of the remains, nor is it a type of funeral service.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Is a casket needed for cremation?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
No, a casket is not required.  Laurel Lawn Cemetery Association requires that all bodies are placed in a body bag or cardboard container. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Is embalming required prior to cremation?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
No.  In fact, it is against the law for a funeral home to tell you otherwise.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Can the body be viewed without embalming?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Yes, immediate family members can briefly view the deceased prior to cremation.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Can the family witness the cremation?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Yes, they can.  Family members and loved ones can be present when the body is placed in the cremation chamber.  Some religious groups even include this as part of their funeral custom.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What can be done with the cremated remains?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
While laws very state by state, for the most part cremated remains can be buried in a crematory lot or cremation garden, interred in a columbarium, kept at home or scattered.  At Laurel Lawn Cemetery, we allow the purchase of crematory lots.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">How can I be sure I receive the correct remains?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
As a registered member of the Cremation Association of North America (CANA), we have developed a rigorous set of operating policies and procedures in order to maximize the level of service and minimize the potential for human error.  Our employees are certified crematory operators that put forth the effort to treat your loved ones with the respect they deserve.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">How long does the actual cremation take?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
It all depends on the weight of the individual.  An average sized adult can take two to three hours at a normal operating temperature of between 1,500 and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What do the cremated remains look like?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Cremated remains consists of granular particulates that range in size from a powder to U.S. dime size fragments and has a color that ranges from white to charcoal.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Are all cremated remains returned?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
With the exception of minute and microscopic particles, which are impossible to remove from the cremation chamber and processing machine, all of the cremated remains are given back to the family.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Do I need an urn?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
An urn is not required by law.  All cremains are returned to the funeral home in hard plastic temporary urn containers.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What are religious viewpoints on cremation?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Most major religions readily accept cremation.  For those who believe in Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism cremation is part of their religious ceremony.  The Catholic Church does allow cremation, but requires that the final disposition of the cremated remains involves interment or entombment.  Protestants allow cremation without requiring interment or entombment.  Islam and Orthodox Judaism do not allow cremation.  Reformed and Conservative branches of Judaism accept cremation, although it is not commonly practiced by them. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Can a cremation be done directly through the cemetery?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
No.  New Jersey state law requires a funeral home be in charge of the final disposition of the remains.  All cremations must be done through funeral homes.

<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">How can I decorate a burial plot?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
We require all decorations to remain on the person’s burial plot and decorations must be within two feet of the monument stone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What decorations can I use to decorate a burial plot?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
Any and all decorations are welcome, within reason, as long as they are within two feet of the monument.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Do you have types of decorations that you recommend?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
We always recommend real flowers/plants instead of plastic.  Plastic decorations deteriorate will be moved periodically for groundskeeping.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Do you ever remove decorations?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
As plastic decorations deteriorate and begin to negatively impact the beauty of the cemetery, we will remove them.  Also, twice a year we remove a large amount of decorations: in early December we remove decorations that are meant for spring time and summer, and on February 1, we remove all decorations from the holiday season.  Every Memorial Day, new American flags are put on by the local chapter of the American Legion.  The old flags are removed a week beforehand.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Do you sell monument stones?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
No, we do not sell or install monument stones and it is against the law for cemeteries to sell monuments in the state of New Jersey.  Stones must be ordered from a monument company and they must put in a work order with Laurel Lawn Cemetery Association to create a foundation at least 15 days before the stone would arrive.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">Can I put a bench at the foot of a cemetery plot?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
We ask to be approached before placing a bench.  It must be placed on just that person’s burial plot (not in designated walking paths or on somebody else’s owned plot).  Depending on the weight of the bench, it may require a foundation be put in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">How much do you charge for foundations?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
We charge $0.60 (60 cents) per square inch.  The maximum foundation size for a single space is two feet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1">
<h3 class="marketing-header">What are your business hours?</h3>
</div>
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
<p>
We have staff on hand Monday through Friday, 8:00am-4:00pm.  If you would like to meet with us outside this time frame, please call us at (856) 455-6217 to make an appointment.
